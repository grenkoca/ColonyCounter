# ColonyCounter
A silly lil program that lets a user input an image of a petri dish on a dark background (like a lab table) and it returns a count of how many cell colonies are in the dish.

## Usage:
```python main.py ./sample_data/IMG_3722.jpg -show_results True```

Additionally you can run this sequentially on as many images as you want. Try running two images at once:

```python main.py ./sample_data/IMG_3722.jpg ./sample_data/IMG_3732.jpg```


## Installation:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or use conda if you're so inclined.
